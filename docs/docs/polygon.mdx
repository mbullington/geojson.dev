import CodeWithMap from "../src/components/CodeWithMap";

To specify a constraint specific to Polygons, it is useful to introduce the concept of a **linear ring**:

- A linear ring is a closed [LineString](#linestring) with **four or more positions**
- The **first and last** positions are **equivalent**
- A linear ring is the boundary of a surface
- A linear ring must follow the right-hand rule. Exterior rings are counterclockwise, and holes are clockwise.

For type `Polygon`, the `coordinates` member must be an array of linear ring coordinate arrays.

No holes:

<CodeWithMap

    type: "Polygon",

      [
        [100.0, 0.0],
